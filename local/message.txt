Dear Atrie, Happy 22nd Birthday.

I hope this year is gentle with you…
the kind that gives you calm mornings, honest smiles,
and moments that feel lighter than the ones you’ve carried before.

You’re someone who thinks deeply, feels quietly, and cares more than you let on and I’ve always admired that about you.

I won’t wish for big things today.
Just that you keep choosing yourself, keep trusting your pace,
and keep believing that you deserve things that feel real and safe.

Wherever life takes you next,
I hope it meets you with the same warmth you bring into the lives you touch.

Have the happiest birthday 🌻
